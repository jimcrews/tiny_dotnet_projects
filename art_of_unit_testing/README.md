A mock object is like a stub, but it also helps you to assert something in your test. A stub can never fail your test and is strictly there to simulate various situations.

Combining stubs and mocks in the same test is a powerful technique, but you must take care to have no more than one mock in each test. The rest of the fake objects should be stubs that canâ€™t break your test.
